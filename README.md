Product Management System

The web application is designed to manage product, category and article information. The project
implements the Server-side Rendering (SSR) approach, with two main parts: admin and client. In the admin
part, users can add, edit and delete product, category and article information, as well as manage
user rights. The client part allows filtering, searching, ordering, requesting password resets and user authentication and registration.
